# Laptop stand: 13 inches (e.g., mac air, etc)

## Laptop stand for Mac Air with Minila Keyboard
This stand fits a Filco Minila Keyboard under. The keyboard stays inside perfectly to tidy up your workspace when you are not working. 
Note the cutout on one of the crossbars, that is intended to pass the USB cables from the Filco.
